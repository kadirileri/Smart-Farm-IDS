The dataset, named **Smart-Farm-IDS** (Smart Farming Intrusion Detection System Dataset), was created to support research on intrusion detection in smart farming environments. It contains extensive data collected from a comprehensive smart farming system, labeled for binary classification of normal versus anomalous activities. This dataset aims to facilitate advances in cybersecurity for precision agriculture systems by providing high-quality, real-world data. The **Smart-Farm-IDS** dataset was generated using an established smart farming system composed of three main components: the irrigation system, the condition monitoring system, and the central control system. Detailed descriptions of the system components, sensors, and the specific parameters measured by these sensors are provided in the accompanying introductory paper below.
